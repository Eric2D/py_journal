# Python Journal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my very first python project. The program opens and writes information to files.
There is a basic journal feature and a password keeping feature. The idea came from a plan
I had to hide my passwords from regular non-deving folk. This being a terminal based program
makes it awkward and inconveniet to use, but it works! 

I am no longer working on this project, however there are bits of code and concepts here
that I think would be somewhat insightful to tinker with for beginners.
